<h1> Tipsy Trivia: The Code Inquiziters Pub Quiz </h1>

[View the live project here] ()

Tipsy Trivia is an interactive website game which is an entertaining general knowledge test exercise. The game is engaging, and is challenging for brain puzzles and information recall to test the audience's general knowledge ability. The site is targeted towards people who are interested in gaming and people who are curious about testing their general knowledge skills. The interactive site has a USP of user friendly design and visuals to make the game accessible to a wide audience. The interactive website is particularly engaging with its use of a game timer, a score counter and clear option choices to encourage and motivate the audience to engage and continue to practice their skills.

    *Screenshot of timer*

    We added a timer so users can see how long they have taken to complete the quiz.

    The next question populates automatically after a short delay once the user has answered the current question as this provides a sleeker design.

    There is a score counter that updates after each correct answer so the user can keep track of their score.

    *Restart Button*
    There is a restart button created by JavaScript at the end of the quiz to allow users to play again.

    *Loading Placeholder*
    There is a html image that acts as a placeholder whilst the questions load.
